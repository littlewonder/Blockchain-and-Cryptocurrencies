## Distributed Database: 
A distributed database is a database in which **storage devices are not all attached to a common processor**. It may be stored in multiple computers, located in the same physical location; or may be dispersed over a network of interconnected computers.

Two processes ensure that the distributed databases remain up-to-date and current: replication and duplication.

- Replication involves using specialised software that **looks for changes in the distributive database**. Once the changes have been identified, the replication process makes all the databases look the same. The replication process can be complex and time-consuming depending on the size and number of the distributed databases. This process can also require a lot of time and computer resources.
- Duplication, on the other hand, has less complexity. It basically **identifies one database as a master and then duplicates that database.** The duplication process is normally done at **a set time** after hours. This is to ensure that **each distributed location has the same data**. In the duplication process, **users may change only the master database**. This ensures that local data will not be overwritten.

## Proof of Work:
A proof-of-work (PoW) system is an economic measure to **deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses** such as spam on a network **by requiring some work from the service requester**, usually meaning processing time by a computer.  Verification however is easy.

**51% attack** - Results in double spending. I can make a private chain since I have highest hashing power and at the same time spend from the public chain. Then later I will announce private chain in public and network will accept it since it is the longest. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxyGt58EPa4)
